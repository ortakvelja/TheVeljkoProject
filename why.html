            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>It all began on April 24, 2020, when Josh Swain created a group message on facebook messenger with 10 randomly selected people also named Josh Swain. His ultimate goal was to host the Josh vs Josh fight, which happened a year later after the
                creation of the group. <span>We</span> (The Veljkos) have took massive inspiration from this world changing phenomenon and have decided to host our own Veljko vs Veljko convention, but with a slight twist. </p>
